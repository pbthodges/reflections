What happens when you initialize a repository. Why do you need to do it?

.git directory is created ready to track changes. No files are tracked at this point.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where files are added to be commited in the next commit.
It allows you to select which files are to be included in a commit.
