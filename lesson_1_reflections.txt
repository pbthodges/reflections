How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
    It narrowed down the number of lines to examine.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy to go back to a previous version if make a mistake.
    Could produce executables based on older versions of code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - Changes are logically grouped
    cons - Might forget to commit
    Pros - Avoids forgetting to commit
    Cons - Commits probably won't be at an appropriate time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git was invented for programmers, so it makes sense to have multiple sources in a commit as programs are made up of multiple sources.
    Google Docs is document based.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows you the data and times of commits and a description.
    Git diff shows you what is different between 2 commits so can see what changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because its easy to switch back to a previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
