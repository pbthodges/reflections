When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share with others.
When you want an offsite/off computer backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The remote repository may contain changes from a 3rd party which may conflict with what you are currently working on.



What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do.

The history of commits is merged based on date/time, and a new commit is created which has parents of the 2 merged branches.
The diagram makes it easier to visualize the branches.
