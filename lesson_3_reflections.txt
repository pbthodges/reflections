When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share with others.
When you want an offsite/off computer backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The remote repository may contain changes from a 3rd party which may conflict with what you are currently working on.
